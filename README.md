# Data Academy

A series of workshops about using data effectively to ask and answer questions. You will generate a question to investigate, then use data systems and Excel to extract and explore related data. Finally, you will apply best practices for data literacy and communication to share the answer to your question. Up to fifteen clock hours will be available to cover both meeting time and homework.
