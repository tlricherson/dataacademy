# 5 - Storytelling with Data #

A data story combines text, data, and visual elements. During this session, we will consider the [ethics of design choices](https://pinboard.in/u:tlricherson/t:ethics), the responsibilities of communicating data in equitable ways, and how we can use [basic statistics](https://pinboard.in/u:tlricherson/t:statistics) to know when we have a story.

## Statistics ##
Statistics can be a useful tool for evaluating both data and the stories they tell.
* An article over at The Conversation summarizes [The Seven Deadly Sins of Statistics...and How to Avoid Them](http://theconversation.com/the-seven-deadly-sins-of-statistical-misinterpretation-and-how-to-avoid-them-74306).
* Visit my [statistics bookmarks](https://pinboard.in/u:tlricherson/t:statistics) on Pinboard for everything from basic explanations to tools and visuals to support your understanding.

## Bunny trails ##
We are rarely good storytellers...but why? An article from PsychCentral explores [why most people are awful storytellers](https://psychcentral.com/news/2017/02/15/why-most-people-are-awful-storytellers/116460.html) and The Book of Life provides some tips on [how to narrate your dreams](http://www.thebookoflife.org/how-to-narrate-your-dreams/). Even better, check out [The Art of Storytelling](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar/storytelling), a free course from Pixar. It is part of their [Pixar in a Box](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar) program that helps you learn how their artists do their jobs.

Browse the [projects from the Tactical Technology Collective](https://tacticaltech.org/projects/all). These focus on three themes: politics of data, digital security and privacy, and exposing and shaping issues. [The White Room](https://tacticaltech.org/WhiteRoom) is highly recommended. You can also watch Marek Tuszynski speak about the project in this [Eyeo 2016 presentation](https://vimeo.com/178236532).

Read [Miriam Posner](https://twitter.com/miriamkp)'s summary of her keynote on [The radical potential of the Digital Humanities: The most challenging computing problem is the interrogation of power](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/08/12/the-radical-unrealized-potential-of-digital-humanities/) to think more about structures of power, like race and gender, as they relate to how we use data.

[Lauren Klein](https://twitter.com/laurenfklein) has written about [visualization as argument](http://lklein.com/2014/12/visualization-as-argument/). You may also be interested in her presentation on [feminist data visualization](http://www.northeastern.edu/nulab/lauren-klein-feminist-data-visualization/) or view [all of her projects](http://dhlab.lmc.gatech.edu/projects/).

A pop-up shop in London will trade you your data for something you want to buy. Take a look [inside the store that only accepts personal data as currency](https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/07/data-dollar-store-london-ben-eine/).
