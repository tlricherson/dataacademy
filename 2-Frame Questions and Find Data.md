# 2-Frame questions and find data #

We will focus on asking high-leverage questions, then using data mining, canned reports and extracts, and other options to pull relevant data from Skyward and Homeroom to answer these questions.

## Skyward ##
* [Attendance reports](https://github.com/tlricherson/dataacademy/blob/master/documents/Attendance%20Reports%20in%20Skyward.pdf)
* [Discipline reports](https://github.com/tlricherson/dataacademy/blob/master/documents/Discipline%20Reports%20in%20Skyward.pdf)

## Homeroom ##
You can access a variety of [supporting documents](https://sdshelpdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) on the district web site. You may also log in to the [Help Center](https://sdshelpdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) on the School Data Solutions web site to search for answers to specific questions, view tutorials, or suggest improvements.

There are many places to find additional data sets for education (and other areas!). Here are a few to get you started:
* You can download assessment, attendance, demographic, and graduation data for our state from the [Data Files](http://reportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/DataDownload.aspx) area of the OSPI web site. For even more data, including fiscal, human resources, and transportation, visit [Data Administration](http://www.k12.wa.us/dataadmin/).
* The [Educational Research Data Center (ERDC)](http://www.erdc.wa.gov/) has built a longitudinal data system that includes information on Washington students across multiple sectors. These sectors include early learning, K-12, post-secondary, and workforce sectors. These data are shared with ERDC by partnering agencies and institutions across the state. In this way, ERDC acts as a kind of “central hub,” where partnering agencies, institutions, and organizations can pool their data and seek answers to questions that none of them have the resources to answer by themselves.
* Visit the [National Center for Educational Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/) is the primary federal entity for collecting and analyzing data related to education in the U.S. and other nations. You may also be interested in the [Civil Rights Data Collection](https://ocrdata.ed.gov/) which collects and publishes educational data related to civil rights and equity.
* Many public organizations have open data collections (and, if not, you can obtain information through the public disclosure process). Here are some [links to additional collections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0), including wikipedia edits, air quality, Pokemon, and more.

What do we do about missing data...and why is it missing in the first place? [Mimi Onuoha](https://twitter.com/thistimeitsmimi) has started a repo to [explore this topic](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets). At the 2016 Tapestry Conference, [Eva Galanes-Rosenbaum](https://twitter.com/NotoriousEGR) shares that [the plural of anecdote is not "data"...except when it is](http://www.tapestryconference.com/blog/2016/plural-anecdote-not-data%E2%80%94except-when-it) as a way to show how we can mitigate the effects of missing data.
