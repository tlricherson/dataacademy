# 2-Frame questions and find data #

We will focus on asking high-leverage questions, then using data mining, canned reports and extracts, and other options to pull relevant data from Skyward and Homeroom to answer these questions.

## Questions ##
Effective data use begins with a good question. This establishes a purpose for using the data and making predictions to enhance learning. A few sample questions are below, but you can also [view more ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DhOa5GSvwWsVc2UY163-98doHWNE4H-LN7mupu4kMos/edit?usp=sharing), if needed.
* What is the relationship between student attendance and achievement on the Smarter Balanced ELA assessment for my students?
* Do Kindergartners who ride the bus have fewer absences...and if so, what are the most effective supports for increasing attendance with our other students?
* What are the characteristics of students who do not complete high school in our district?

## Homeroom ##
You can access a variety of [supporting documents](https://sdshelpdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) on the district web site. You may also log in to the [Help Center](https://sdshelpdesk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) on the School Data Solutions web site to search for answers to specific questions, view tutorials, or suggest improvements.

## Other ##
There are many places to find additional data sets for education (and other areas!). Here are a few to get you started:
* You can download assessment, attendance, demographic, and graduation data for our state from the [Data Files](http://reportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/DataDownload.aspx) area of the OSPI web site. Some files are also available as [performance indicators](http://www.k12.wa.us/DataAdmin/PerformanceIndicators/DataAnalytics.aspx). For even more data, including fiscal, human resources, and transportation, visit [Data Administration](http://www.k12.wa.us/dataadmin/).
* The [Educational Research Data Center (ERDC)](http://www.erdc.wa.gov/) has built a longitudinal data system that includes information on Washington students across multiple sectors. These sectors include early learning, K-12, post-secondary, and workforce sectors. These data are shared with ERDC by partnering agencies and institutions across the state. In this way, ERDC acts as a kind of “central hub,” where partnering agencies, institutions, and organizations can pool their data and seek answers to questions that none of them have the resources to answer by themselves.
* Visit the [National Center for Educational Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/) is the primary federal entity for collecting and analyzing data related to education in the U.S. and other nations. You may also be interested in the [Civil Rights Data Collection](https://ocrdata.ed.gov/) which collects and publishes educational data related to civil rights and equity.
* Many public organizations have open data collections (and, if not, you can obtain information through the public disclosure process). Here are some [links to additional collections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0), including wikipedia edits, air quality, Pokemon, and more.

What do we do about missing data...and why is it missing in the first place? [Mimi Onuoha](https://twitter.com/thistimeitsmimi) has started a repo to [explore this topic](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets). At the 2016 Tapestry Conference, [Eva Galanes-Rosenbaum](https://twitter.com/NotoriousEGR) shares that [the plural of anecdote is not "data"...except when it is](http://www.tapestryconference.com/blog/2016/plural-anecdote-not-data%E2%80%94except-when-it) as a way to show how we can mitigate the effects of missing data.
