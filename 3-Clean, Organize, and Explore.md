## Tips and tricks ##
* [Maarten Lambrects](https://twitter.com/maartenzam) has a whole [course in cleaning data](https://learno.net/courses/cleaning-data-in-excel). This is especially valuable for large data sets.

* Learn more about pivot tables with these videos ([Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NUjHBNWe9M) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g530cnFfk8Y)). Like many resources, they present things through a business lens, but the overall mechanics will work for your data, too.

* Have a large load of dirty data? Try [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/) or the [Data Wrangle](http://vis.stanford.edu/wrangler/) to jumpstart the clean up process.

* I also keep a list of [Excel sites](https://pinboard.in/u:tlricherson/t:Excel) tagged in Pinboard that you can use as a reference.
