Itâ€™s time to sharpen your skills with Excel, including how to join data from multiple sources, build pivot tables, as well as formula basics.

## Tips and tricks ##
* Have a large load of dirty data? Try [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/) or the [Data Wrangle](http://vis.stanford.edu/wrangler/) to jumpstart the clean up process.
* [Maarten Lambrects](https://twitter.com/maartenzam) has a whole [course in cleaning data](https://learno.net/courses/cleaning-data-in-excel). This is especially valuable for large data sets.
* Learn more about pivot tables with these videos ([Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NUjHBNWe9M) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g530cnFfk8Y)). Like many resources, they present things through a business lens, but the overall mechanics will work for your data, too.
* I also keep a list of [Excel sites](https://pinboard.in/u:tlricherson/t:Excel) tagged in Pinboard that you can use as a reference.
* If you have a lot of data to track, you'll need an organized system and structure for [file naming](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf). Jenny Bryan has shared some excellent tips on how to do this.

## Bunny trails ##
The world runs on Excel, but it is certainly not the only game in town. [The Chartmaker Directory](http://chartmaker.visualisingdata.com/) can show you examples of different ways to create with data. Over at the [Data Viz Tools](http://dataviz.tools/) site, you can find support not only for cleaning and organizing your data, but to scrape data, find add-ons, and more. 

The [R Project](https://www.r-project.org/) is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of platforms. Because it is open source, there is a robust community of support and lots of free courses available. It is a natural next step for anyone who would like to move beyond Excel's capabilities, or bring their work into an online space. Here are [some additional resources](https://pinboard.in/u:tlricherson/t:R_Studio/) to get you started.
